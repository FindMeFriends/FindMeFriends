  <!-- Introduction Text Section -->
  <section class="intro-text">
    <p>We’re a bunch of first-year software engineering students diving into our first big project, an app to help people find friends nearby. Think of it as a mix of coding, caffeine, and a whole lot of ambition. We're here to learn, create, and maybe even make something useful!</p>

        <h3>Deggan Farah</h3>
        <p class="title">Title</p>
        <p class="bio">Deggan is our ambitious dreamer, convinced that no website is complete without a few perfectly placed GIFs—even if we’re all still figuring out the basics. She’ll throw out an idea faster than we can Google how to make it happen, and somehow, we usually end up giving it a shot. Her favorite phrase? 'How hard could it be?' Spoiler alert: it’s usually harder than she thinks. But hey, her enthusiasm keeps us on our toes, and our website definitely has more personality because of it!</p>

        <h3>Nikolas Kaern</h3>
        <p class="title">Title</p>
        <p class="bio">Nikolas is convinced that every app should be a masterpiece and every line of code a work of art. He’s the type to come up with a 'revolutionary' idea in the middle of a meeting, only to say he’ll start working on it… tomorrow. His ambitions are big, and his follow-through? Well, it’s getting there. But when he does get coding, he’s all in—until the next 'genius' idea comes along!</p>

        <h3>Yuli-Anne Rainville</h3>
        <p class="title">Title</p>
        <p class="bio">Yuli-Anne is the glue holding our team together (with a little help from her cats). Between wrangling deadlines and keeping us all on track, she’s got a knack for juggling schedules, assignments, and occasional feline 'assistance.' Her cats might be the real project managers—just don’t let her hear you say that!</p>

        <h3>Rolf Addoumie</h3>
        <p class="title">Title</p>
        <p class="bio">Rolf believes that every pixel and every line of code deserves perfection. Known for his endless quest to make things both beautiful and efficient, he’ll happily spend hours fine-tuning the design down to the last detail. Just don’t ask him why the 'perfect' shade of blue matters so much—unless you have a spare afternoon!</p>

      <div class="text-block">
        <h3>Shirina Huang</h3>
        <p class="title">Title</p>
        <p class="bio">With her iPad in hand and a steady stream of ideas, Shirina is the creative force behind our website. She’s got a vision for every detail, and without her, we’d still be debating color schemes. Somehow, she keeps things looking polished, even when we’re scrambling behind the scenes. If it weren’t for Shirina, we’d probably still be staring at a blank page.</p>
